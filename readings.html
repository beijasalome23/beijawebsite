<p>Reading 1 Prompt</p>
<p>The opening chapter from Susan Sontag's On Photography reflects upon the power of image taking. Well before the advent of the smartphone, Sontag discusses the ubiquity of the camera and image taking. This is the longest reading of the semester for this course. The reading is assigned to place image making in a critical context. What does it mean to you to capture images and create graphics? Through the length of the semester, you will be asked to realize ten projects, each project quite different from the other as you are asked to use various tools. Although each project is distinct, please consider them as a body of work; consider how one may relate to the next and how you as a media maker can build from one to the next. Please write a 500-word reflection on how you use photography and image making. How could you represent visually through photography or illustration or the combination of image and text notions of our world at this moment? </p></i>

In Susan Sontag's opening chapter, "In Plato’s Cave" from On Photography, the power of images are examined. More specifically, she examines their ability to shape, limit, and even distort our perception of reality. She also argues how photographs create "surrogate"-like experience in the sense that moments of reality are captured, preserved, and recirculated. Photography is never neutral for Sontag as it both reveals and conceals. While reading her chapter, I began to reflect on my own use of photography in my life and how they serve as both an imitation of my experiences and tools to help shape how I want the world to appear.

Overall, I feel that photography is very intertwined with memory. I consider it to be a privilege to actually capture a moment from your life that you enjoyed or felt was significant enough to remember. For example, the camera roll on my phone serves as a digital diary or personal archive filled with my friends, family gatherings, pretty-looking meals, and even sunsets that I know are prettier without the camera. I keep these moments in my camera roll to remind myself later on how enjoyable those days were and how a simple picture of a burger is worth remembering. Sontag states that "to photograph is to appropriate," and I resonated with that in which when I take a picture, I am also having control over how I choose to remember that memory. I choose what my subject is, when to capture it, and which images to keep or delete. By this, photographs execute a personal version of the world, which is curated, partial, and sometimes even more flattering than reality.

I also view photography as a method of storytelling. Aside from documentation, photos allow me to express my moods, ideas, and even critiques. A single photo of a busy street can demonstrate a feeling of somberness. Another photo of a crowd from a concert can reveal the truth of music bringing people together. I find that combining text with images, whether that be through captions, quotes, or passages, creates a deeper, more authentic layer of meaning. Text sets images in place. They guide interpretation while also allowing viewers to bring their own opinions.

While also capturing personal moments, I also feel that images can also capture the contradictions our time by specifically taking the current state of the world now into consideration. I feel that my generation struggles to find balance between having a social life with being dependent on our digital devices. It has almost “flipped” in a way of communication by having a hyper-connection through digital media and alienation remains as a common theme. An image that can illustrate this would be set in a busy restaurant where there is dim lighting and the main subject is a person who’s face is lit by their really bright phone. The juxtaposition from this type of image would highlight the problem of constantly being connected yet emotionally distant in a primarily social setting.

Overall, Sontag’s chapter reminded me that images aren’t just about capturing moments we find appealing or worth remembering, but they also shape how we visualize the world and ourselves. I wouldn’t document just one existence of something, but also aim to promote reflection when trying to represent a moment visually. Using text to anchor visual ideas will also enhance the severity of the possibilities of this digital era we live in and how it will effect future generations.
