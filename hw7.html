<h1>Homework 7: Illustrated Environment</h1>

<i><p>I chose the New York City skyline as an environment because of how recognizable it is. Its layers and urban structure; even from afar, make it a good subject for illustration. Forming this project started with importing the original photo as a template via Pexels. Then, I locked the photo template layer and created three extra layers labelling each as the background, middle ground, and foreground. After that I went to the Adobe Color CC website to make a customized triad palette with pastel versions of pink, green, and blue. To incorporate those colors into my project, I copied the HEX code number and pasted it into each layer to prepare for the tracing. Starting with the background, I made sure the photo template was locked and used the pen tool to trace the sky and buildings up until they met the middle ground. The following layers went smoothly when tracing the middle and foreground since the anchor points were still visible and accessible when using a new color. I relied mainly on the Pen and Eraser Tool to create the once 3 dimensional skyline into a flat and graphic illustration of New York City while still maintaining its urban essence.
